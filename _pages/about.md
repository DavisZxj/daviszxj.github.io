Hi there! I'm Davis Zhang, a senior studying Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). At UIUC, I am fortunate to work with Professor [Deepak Vasisht](https://deepakv.web.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and wireless sensing - how can machine learning techniques be incorporated to unleash the sensing capabilities of ubiquitous WiFi/6G signals?

Outside of research, I enjoy watching and playing sports, especially tennis and basketball. My trademark dish to cook is tomatoes and eggs, and it has received rave reviews from my friends (willingly).

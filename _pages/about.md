Hi there! My name is Davis (Chinese name 张行健). I'm a senior studying Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and an [IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute](https://discoveryacceleratorinstitute.grainger.illinois.edu/) scholar.

At UIUC, I'm fortunate to work with Professor [Deepak Vasisht](https://deepakv.web.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). My research interests are multifold; I'm interested in building machine learning models and programming systems that more efficiently leverage the enormous computational power of modern hardware. I'm also keen on exploring the intersection of deep learning and wireless sensing - how can machine learning techniques be incorporated to unleash the sensing capabilities of ubiquitous WiFi/cellular signals?

Outside of research, I enjoy watching all kinds of sports, as well as playing tennis and basketball. I've also picked up cooking in college. My trademark dish is [tomatoes and eggs](/assets/img/tomatoes_and_eggs.jpg), and it has received rave reviews from my friends (willingly).

I'm born and raised in Singapore! Before UIUC, I studied at [Hwa Chong Institution](https://www.hci.edu.sg/) for 6 wonderful years.
